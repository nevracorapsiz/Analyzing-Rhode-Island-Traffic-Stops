# Analyzing Rhode Island Traffic Stops

For this project, I used the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and Climate Data from NCEI (National Centers for Environmental Information).

The project shows us the relationship between gender and policing in many ways. It also shows the arrest rate by region, arrest rate by month of the year, arrest rate by time of the day, arrest count by year, the contraband proportion by year, and reasons for stopping vehicles by zones. Additionally, to examine the impact of weather on policing, I used Climate Data belong Rhode Island. In this way, I examined the relationship between weather conditions to the arrest rate.

# The project answers the following questions:

What is the rate of stopping vehicles by driver gender?
What is the arrest rate by gender?
What is the arrest rate by race?
For what reason are women drivers mostly stopped?
For what reason are male drivers mostly stopped?
For what reason are women drivers mostly arrested?
For what reason are male drivers mostly arrested?
What is the arrest rate by zone?
What is the arrest rate by year?
What is the arrest rate by month of the year?
What is the arrest rate by time of the day?
What is the contraband rate by year?
For what reasons were drivers in the K zones stopped?
For what reasons were drivers in the X zones stopped?
What is the effect of weather conditions on the arrest rate?
What is the relationship between the reasons for arrest and the weather conditions?
